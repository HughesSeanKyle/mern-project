<!-- App architecture -->
# Client 
- The app will have two types of state 
- 1. Universal State (Redux store)
- 2. Local State 
    - State is contained within a component and not shared with other components

- Authentication
- 1. The state contained inside the React hook form does not necessarily be part of universal state (Redux store). However, if a feature is needed where the user's log in attempts need to be limited then form state will have to be universal or at least communicate with universal state via an action ("state updating" helper function)
