    Reducer: A function that takes in a piece of state. (Any state that has to do with alerts, and an action)
    - An action will get dispatched from an actions file  

    Action: Will contain two things 
        - 1. Type (Mandatory)
            - This is evaluated with a switch statement 
        - 2. Payload (data)
            - Sometime you might not have any data and just call an action type, but with no data.
